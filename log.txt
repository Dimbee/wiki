His debut was at UFC on Fuel in Sweden, against a strong Marcus Brimage. They both exchanged blows in the centre of the Octagon before McGregor began using his signature counter left hand to little effect. Understanding that his shots were missing, he began utilising his looping left uppercut which quickly found its target and dropped Brimage to his knees. From there, it was a simple case of finishing the fight which ended after 1:07 in the first round and awarded Conor his first knockout in the UFC and a Knockout of the night bonus. <br><br>His second fight was against, the now Featherweight champion, Max Holloway. This proved more testing than his first bout as Holloway’s speed mitigated much of Conor’s arsenal. This was also the first time fans witnessed the power of Conor’s ground game, nullifying Max’s attempts at gaining position while capitalising from top control. Conor won the bout by unanimous decision but tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) keeping him out of action for the next ten months.
