Born on the 14th of July, 1988 from Dublin Ireland, Conor McGregor is the UFC's most famous MMA fighter with a record of 21 wins (18 knockouts) & 3 loses. His meteoric rise to fame can largely be attributed to his abilities in and outside of the ring, with his trash talk gaining him considerable notoriety. Since his humble beginnings in his former promotion, Cage Fighters, he is now the first UFC fighter to hold two belts at different weight divisions consecutively and has been one of the very few sport personalities to transition from MMA into boxing, with his bout against Floyd Maywhether being dubbed as one of the greatest sporting events of our lifetimes. <br><br> As a rising star within the Irish MMA circuit, it was only a matter of time before Dana White (President of the UFC) would hear news of The Notorious One and invite him to perform at a UFC event. His debut was at UFC on Fuel in Sweden, against a strong Marcus Brimage. They both exchanged blows in the centre of the Octagon before McGregor began using his signature counter left hand to little effect. Understanding that his shots were missing, he began utilising his looping left uppercut which quickly found its target and dropped Brimage to his knees. From there, it was a simple case of finishing the fight which ended after 1:07 in the first round and awarded Conor his first knockout in the UFC and a Knockout of the night bonus. <br><br>His second fight was against, the now Featherweight champion, Max Holloway. This proved more testing than his first bout as Holloway’s speed mitigated much of Conor’s arsenal. This was also the first time fans witnessed the power of Conor’s ground game, nullifying Max’s attempts at gaining position while capitalising from top control. Conor won the bout by unanimous decision but tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) keeping him out of action for the next ten months.
